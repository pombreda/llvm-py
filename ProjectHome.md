_llvm-py_ is a [Python](http://www.python.org/) package that provides Python bindings for [LLVM](http://llvm.org/).

All the interesting stuff is at: http://www.mdevan.org/llvm-py/. Only the [SVN](http://code.google.com/p/llvm-py/source/checkout), [bug tracker](http://code.google.com/p/llvm-py/issues/list) and [downloads](http://code.google.com/p/llvm-py/downloads/list) are here.

There is now also mailing list / group [here](http://groups.google.com/group/llvm-py).

The website/documentation is frequently out-of-date, please check the SVN HEAD for compatibility with latest LLVM.
