llvm-py: Python Bindings for LLVM
===================================

llvm-py provides http://www.python.org/[Python] bindings for
http://llvm.org/[LLVM]. It's goal is to expose enough of LLVM APIs to
implement a compiler or VM in pure Python. Currently, llvm-py is
available for LLVM 2.3 and Python 2.5, on Linux/x86. It is expected to
be usable on various unices, as well as with Python 2.4, with minimal
changes, if any. It should be stable enough for you to play with.

llvm-py is just hatching, and your contributions would be most welcome.
