llvm-py: Python Bindings for LLVM
===================================

_llvm-py_ provides http://www.python.org/[Python] bindings for
http://llvm.org/[LLVM]. It currently provides APIs to build the in-memory IR
(intermediate representation) and to dump it. Execution engine and related APIs
should appear soon.

_llvm-py_ is a set of Python-based and C-based Python modules. It makes use of
llvm-c, the C binding for LLVM. It is based on the latest SVN version of LLVM
(and will not work on 2.2). It has been tested only with Python 2.5, although
it should be usable with 2.4 also. I've built and tested it only on Linux/i386
machines.
