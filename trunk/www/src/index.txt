llvm-py: Python Bindings for LLVM
===================================

llvm-py provides http://www.python.org/[Python] bindings for
http://llvm.org/[LLVM]. It's goal is to expose enough of LLVM APIs to
implement a compiler backend or a VM in pure Python. llvm-py consists of
Python and C modules that wrap over the native C++/C bindings of LLVM,
and does not use / have dependencies on "glue utilities" like
Boost.Python, swig etc.

llvm-py is just hatching. It should be stable enough to start hacking
away, though. Be sure to send in a patch (or shout at the author) if you
miss any specific LLVM API.

_Availability_: llvm-py is available (as a source package) for LLVM 2.3
and Python 2.5. It has been built and tested on Linux/i386, and has been
reported to work with OpenBSD. It is expected to be usable on
various unices, as well as with Python 2.4 and LLVM 2.3+svn, with
minimal changes, if any.
