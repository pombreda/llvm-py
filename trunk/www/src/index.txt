llvm-py: Python Bindings for LLVM
===================================

llvm-py provides http://www.python.org/[Python] bindings for
http://llvm.org/[LLVM]. It's goal is to expose enough of LLVM APIs to
implement a compiler backend or a VM in pure Python. Currently, llvm-py is
available for LLVM 2.3 and Python 2.5, on Linux/x86. It is expected to
be usable on various unices, as well as with Python 2.4, with minimal
changes, if any.

llvm-py is just hatching. It should be stable enough to start hacking
away, though. Be sure to send in a patch (or shout at the author) if you
miss any specific LLVM API.
