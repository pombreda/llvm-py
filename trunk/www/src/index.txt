llvm-py: Python Bindings for LLVM
===================================

llvm-py provides http://www.python.org/[Python] bindings for
http://llvm.org/[LLVM]. It's goal is to expose enough of LLVM APIs to
implement a compiler backend or a VM in pure Python. llvm-py consists of
Python and C modules that wrap over the native C++/C bindings of LLVM,
and does not use / have dependencies on "glue utilities" like
Boost.Python, swig etc.

llvm-py is just hatching. It should be stable enough to start hacking
away, though. Be sure to send in a patch if you miss any specific LLVM
API.

_Availability_: llvm-py is available (as a source package) for LLVM 2.3
and Python 2.5. It has been built and tested on Linux (x86, amd64) and
is reported to work with OpenBSD. It is expected to be usable on
various unices, as well as with Python 2.4.

_LLVM 2.4_: Read link:userguide.html#llvm24[this] if you're using LLVM
2.4!
