llvm-py User Guide
===================

llvm-py provides Python bindings for LLVM. This document explains how
you can setup and use it. A working knowledge of Python and a basic idea
of LLVM is assumed.


Introduction
------------

http://www.llvm.org/[LLVM] (Low-Level Virtual Machine) provides enough
infrastructure to use it as the backend for your compiled, or
JIT-compiled language. It provides extensive optimization support, and
static and dynamic (JIT) backends for many platforms. See the website at
http://www.llvm.org/[http://www.llvm.org/] to discover more.

Python bindings for LLVM provides a gentler learning curve for working
with the LLVM APIs. It should also be easier to create working
prototypes and experimental languages using this medium.

.License
Both LLVM and llvm-py are distributed under (different) permissive
open source licenses. llvm-py uses the
http://opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php[new BSD license]. More
information is available link:license.html[here].

.Platforms
Currently, llvm-py has been built and tested only on Linux/x86. However,
it should be trivial to build it on other unices. Windows is not
supported, for a variety of reasons.

.Versions
llvm-py requires verion 2.3 of LLVM. It will not work with previous
versions.

llvm-py has been built and tested with Python 2.5. It should work with
Python 2.4, with minimal changes, if any.


[[install]]
Installation
------------

llvm-py is distributed as a source tarball. You'll need to build and
install it before it can be used. At least the following will be
required for this:

- compilers, both gcc and g++
- Python itself
- Python development files (headers and libraries)
- LLVM, either installed or built

On debian-based systems, the first three can be installed with the
command `sudo apt-get install gcc g++ python python-dev'. Note that
ubuntu repository has an old version of llvm (1.8) which will not work
with llvm-py.

Tip: If LLVM 2.3 does not install cleanly, try installing 'ocamldoc'
first.


llvm-config
~~~~~~~~~~~

Inorder to build llvm-py, it's build script needs to know from where to
invoke the llvm helper program, +llvm-config+. If you've installed LLVM,
then this will be available in your +PATH+, and nothing further needs to
be done. If you've built LLVM yourself, or for any reason +llvm-config+
is not in your +PATH+, you'll need to pass the full path of
+llvm-config+ to the build script.

You'll need to be 'root' to install llvm-py. Remember that your +PATH+
is different from that of 'root', so even if +llvm-config+ is in your
+PATH+, it may not be available when you do +sudo+.


Steps
~~~~~

The commands illustrated below assume that the LLVM source is available
under +/home/mdevan/llvm+. If you've a previous version of llvm-py
installed, you must remove it first, as described
link:#uninstall[below].

If you have +llvm-config+ in your path, you can build and install
llvm-py this way:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
$ tar jxvf llvm-py-0.2.tar.bz2
$ cd llvm-py-0.2
$ sudo python setup.py install
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you need to tell the build script where +llvm-config+ is, do it this
way:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
$ tar jxvf llvm-py-0.2.tar.bz2
$ cd llvm-py-0.2
$ sudo python setup.py install --llvm-config=/home/mdevan/llvm/Release/bin/llvm-config
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To build a debug version of llvm-py, that links against the debug
libraries of LLVM, use this:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
$ tar jxvf llvm-py-0.2.tar.bz2
$ cd llvm-py-0.2
$ python setup.py build -g --llvm-config=/home/mdevan/llvm/Debug/bin/llvm-config
$ sudo python setup.py install -g --llvm-config=/home/mdevan/llvm/Debug/bin/llvm-config
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Be warned that debug binaries will be huge (65MB+) !


[[uninstall]]
Uninstall
~~~~~~~~~

To get rid of llvm-py completely, if you wish to do so:

----
# rm -rf /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/llvm
# rm -f /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/llvm_py-0.1.egg-info
----

- You need to be root to do this. 
- Paths are for debian-based systems, in other distros it might be different.
- Note that there are version numbers (both Python's and llvm-py's)
  which you might need to change to suit your system.


The Concepts
------------

This section explains a few concepts related to LLVM.


Intermediate Representation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The intermediate representation, or IR for short, is an in-memory data
structure that represents executable code. The IR data structures allow
for creation of types, constants, functions, function arguments,
instructions, global variables and so on. For example, to create a
function _sum_ that takes two integers and returns their sum, we need to
follow these steps:

- create an integer type _ti_ of required bitwidth
- create a function type _tf_ which takes two _ti_ -s and returns
  another _ti_
- create a function of type _tf_ named _sum_
- add a _basic block_ to the function
- using a helper object called an _instruction builder_, add two
  instructions into the basic block:
  . an instruction to add the two arguments and store the result into
    a temporary variable
  . a return instruction to return the value of the temporary variable

(A basic block is a block of instructions.)

LLVM has it's own instruction set; the instructions used above (+add+
and +ret+) are from this set. The LLVM instructions are at a higher
level than the usual assembly language; for example there are
instructions related to variable argument handling, exception handling,
and garbage collection. These allow high-level languages to be
represented cleanly in the IR.

SSA Form and PHI Nodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All LLVM instructions are represented in the _Static Single Assignment_
(SSA) form. Essentially, this means that any variable can be assigned to
only once. Such a representation facilitates better optimization, among
other benefits.

A consequence of single assignment are PHI (+++&#934;+++) nodes. These
are required when a variable can be assigned a different value based on
the path of control flow. For example, the value of +b+ at the end of
execution of the snippet below:

----
a = 1;
if (v < 10)
  a = 2;
b = a;
----

cannot be determined statically. The value of '2' cannot be assigned to
the 'original' +a+, since +a+ can be assigned to only once. There are
two +a+ 's in there, and the last assignment has to choose between which
version to pick. This is accomplished by adding a PHI node:

----
a1 = 1;
if (v < 10)
  a2 = 2;
b = PHI(a1, a2);
----

The PHI node selects +a1+ or +a2+, depending on where the control
reached the PHI node. The argument +a1+ of the PHI node is associated
with the block +"a1 = 1;"+ and +a2+ with the block +"a2 = 2;"+.

PHI nodes have to be explicitly created in the LLVM IR. Accordingly the
LLVM instruction set has an instruction called +phi+.


LLVM Assembly Language
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The LLVM IR can be represented offline in two formats
- a textual, human-readable form, similar to assembly language, called
  the LLVM assembly language (files with .ll extension)
- a binary form, called the LLVM bitcode (files with .bc extension)
All three formats (the in-memory IR, the LLVM assembly language and the
LLVM bitcode) represent the _same_ information. Each format can be
converted into the other two formats (using LLVM APIs).

The http://www.llvm.org/demo/[LLVM demo page] lets you type in C or C++
code, converts it into LLVM IR and outputs the IR as LLVM assembly
language code.

Just to get a feel of the LLVM assembly language, here's a function in C,
and the corresponding LLVM assembly (as generated by the demo page):

[C]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
/* compute sum of 1..n */
unsigned sum(unsigned n)
{
  if (n == 0)
    return 0;
  else
    return n + sum(n-1);
}
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The corresponding LLVM assembly:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
; ModuleID = '/tmp/webcompile/_4940_0.bc'
target datalayout = "e-p:32:32:32-i1:8:8-i8:8:8-i16:16:16-i32:32:32-i64:32:64-f32:32:32-f64:32:64-v64:64:64-v128:128:128-a0:0:64-f80:32:32"
target triple = "i386-pc-linux-gnu"

define i32 @sum(i32 %n) nounwind  {
entry:
	%tmp215 = icmp eq i32 %n, 0		; <i1> [#uses=1]
	br i1 %tmp215, label %bb10, label %tailrecurse.bb10_crit_edge

tailrecurse.bb10_crit_edge:		; preds = %entry
	%tmp = add i32 %n, -1		; <i32> [#uses=3]
	%tmp17 = mul i32 %tmp, %tmp		; <i32> [#uses=1]
	%tmp18 = add i32 %tmp17, %n		; <i32> [#uses=1]
	%tmp. = zext i32 %tmp to i64		; <i64> [#uses=2]
	%tmp19 = add i64 %tmp., -1		; <i64> [#uses=1]
	%tmp20 = mul i64 %tmp19, %tmp.		; <i64> [#uses=1]
	%tmp21 = lshr i64 %tmp20, 1		; <i64> [#uses=1]
	%tmp.22 = trunc i64 %tmp21 to i32		; <i32> [#uses=1]
	%tmp24 = sub i32 %tmp18, %tmp.22		; <i32> [#uses=1]
	ret i32 %tmp24

bb10:		; preds = %entry
	ret i32 0
}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Note the usage of SSA form and the total absence of any loop or
recursion at all!

The http://www.llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html[LLVM Language Reference]
defines the LLVM assembly language including the entire instruction set.
The table below lists all the LLVM instructions. Each instruction links
to it's documentation.

include::instrset.inc[]

Intrinsics (instructions that start with +llvm.+) are not yet available
in llvm-py.

Modules
~~~~~~~

Modules, in the LLVM IR, are similar to a single _C_ language source
file (.c file). A module contains:

- functions (declarations and definitions)
- global variables and constants
- global type aliases (typedef-s)

Modules are top-level containers; all executable code representation is
contained within modules.


Optimization and Passes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

LLVM provides quite a few optimization algorithms that work on the IR.
These algorithms are organized as _passes_. Each pass does something
specific, like combining redundant instructions. Passes need not always
optimize the IR, it can also do other operations like inserting
instrumentation code, or analysing the IR (the result of which can be
used by passes that do optimizations) or even printing call graphs.

This LLVM http://www.llvm.org/docs/Passes.html[documentation page]
describes all the available passes, and what they do.

LLVM does not automatically choose to run any passes, anytime. Passes
have to be explicitly selected and run on each module. This gives you
the flexibility to choose transformations and optimizations that are
most suitable for the code in the module.

There is a LLVM binary called http://www.llvm.org/cmds/opt.html[opt],
which lets you run passes on bitcode files from the command line. You
can write your own passes (in C/C\+\+, as a shared library). This can be
loaded and executed by +opt+. (Although llvm-py does not allow you to
write your own passes, it does allow you to navigate the entire IR at
any stage, and perform any transforms on it as you like.)

Passes are run using a _pass manager_. TODO

The llvm-py Package
---------------------

The llvm-py is a Python package, consisting of 6 modules, that wrap
over enough LLVM APIs to allow the implementation of your own
compiler/VM backend in pure Python. If you're come this far, you
probably know why this is a good idea.

Out of the 6 modules, one is an "extension" module (i.e., it's written
in C), and another one is a private utility module, which leaves 4
public modules. These are:

- +llvm+ -- top-level package, common classes (like exceptions)
- +llvm.core+ -- IR-related APIs
- +llvm.ee+ -- execution engine related APIs
- +llvm.passes+ -- pass manager and passes related APIs

The modules contain only classes and (integer) constants. Mostly simple
Python constructs are used (deliberately) --
http://docs.python.org/lib/built-in-funcs.html[property()] and
http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonDecoratorLibrary[property
decorators] are probably the most exotic animals around. All classes are
the "new style" classes. The APIs are designed to be navigable (and
guessable!) once you know a few conventions. These conventions are
highlighted in the sections below.

Here is a quick overview of the contents of each package:

.llvm
- LLVMException -- exception class (currently the only one)

.llvm.core
- Module -- represents an LLVM Module
- Type -- represents an LLVM Type
- IntegerType, FunctionType, StructType, ArrayType, PointerType,
  VectorType  -- derived classes of Type
- TypeHandle -- used for constructing recursive (self-referencing) types
  (e.g. linked list nodes)
- Value -- represents an LLVM Value
- Constant, GlobalValue, GlobalVariable, Argument, Function,
  Instruction, CallOrInvokeInstruction, PHINode, SwitchInstruction --
  various derived classes of Value
- BasicBlock -- another derived of Value, represents an LLVM basic block
- Builder -- used for creating instructions, wraps LLVM IRBuilder helper
  class
- ModuleProvider -- required to use modules in execution engine and pass
  manager
- constants +TYPE_*+ that represents various types
- constants +CC_*+ that represent calling conventions
- constants +IPRED_*+ and +RPRED_*+ that represent integer and real
  comparison predicates (like less than, greater than etc.)
- constants +LINKAGE_*+ that represent linkage of symbols (external,
  internal etc.)
- constants +VISIBILITY_*+ that represents visibility of symbols
  (default, hidden, protected)
- constants +ATTR_*+ that represent function parameter attributes

.llvm.ee
- ExecutionEngine -- represents an execution engine (which can be an
  either an interpreter or a JIT)
- TargetData -- represents the ABI of the target platform (details like
  sizes and alignment of primitive types, endinanness etc)

.llvm.passes
- PassManager -- represents an LLVM pass manager 
- FunctionPassManager -- represents an LLVM function pass manager
- constants +PASS_*+ that represent various passes

.A note on the 'import'ing of these modules
Pythonically, modules are imported with the statement +"import
llvm.core"+ and not +"from llvm.core import *"+. However, you might find
it more convenient to import llvm-py modules thus:

[python]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
from llvm import *
from llvm.core import *
from llvm.ee import *
from llvm.passes import *
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This avoids quite some typing. Both conventions work, however.

TIP: Python-style documentation strings (+__doc__+) are present in
llvm-py. You can use the +help()+ of the interactive Python
interpreter or the +object?+ of http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/[IPython]
to get online help. (Note: not complete yet!)


Module (llvm.core)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Modules are top-level container objects. You need to create a module
object first, before you can add global variables, aliases or functions.
Modules are created using the static method +Module.new+:

[python]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#!/usr/bin/env python

from llvm import *
from llvm.core import *

# create a module
my_module = Module.new('my_module')
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The constructor of the Module class should *not* be used to instantiate
a Module object. This is a common feature for all llvm-py classes.

[TIP]
.Convention
=======================================================================
*All* llvm-py objects are instantiated using static methods of
corresponding classes. Constructors _should not_ be used.
=======================================================================

The argument `my_module` is a module identifier (a plain string). The
attributes of the `Module` class is:

.llvm.core.Module
[caption=""]
=======================================================================
.Static Constructors
`new(module_id)`::
    create a new `Module` instance with given `module_id`. The `module_id`
    should be a string.

.Properties
`data_layout` (r/w)::
    a string representing the ABI of the platform
`target` (r/w)::
    a string like `i386-pc-linux-gnu` or `i386-pc-solaris2.8`
`global_variables` (r)::
    TODO
`functions` (r)::
    TODO

.Methods
`add_type_name`::
    TODO
`delete_type_name`::
    TODO
`add_global_variable`::
    TODO
`get_global_variable_named`::
    TODO

.Special Methods
`\_\_str\_\_`::
    Module objects can be stringified into it's LLVM assembly language
    representation.
`\_\_eq\_\_`::
    Module objects can be compared for equality. Internally, this
    converts both into their LLVM assembly representations and compares
    them.
=======================================================================

Types (llvm.core)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Types are what you think they are. A instance of +llvm.core.Type+, or
one of its derived classes, represent a type. llvm-py does not use as
many classes to represent types as does LLVM itself. Some types are
represented using +llvm.core.Type+ itself and the rest are represented
using derived classes of +llvm.core.Type+. As usual, an instance is created
via one of the static methods of +Type+. These methods return an
instance of either +llvm.core.Type+ itself or one of its derived
classes.

The following table lists all the available types along with the static
method which has to be used to construct it and the name of the class whose
object is actually returned by the static method.

[frame="all",grid="all"]
`50`30`20~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Name,Constructor Method,Class
