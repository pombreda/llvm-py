llvm-py User Guide
===================

_llvm-py_ provides Python bindings for LLVM. This document explains how
you can setup and use it. A working knowledge of Python and a basic idea
of LLVM is assumed.


Introduction
------------

http://www.llvm.org/[LLVM] (Low-Level Virtual Machine) provides enough
infrastructure to use it as the backend for your compiled, or
JIT-compiled language. It provides extensive optimization support, and
static and dynamic (JIT) backends for many platforms. See the website at
http://www.llvm.org/[http://www.llvm.org/] to discover more.

Python bindings for LLVM provides a gentler learning curve for working
with the LLVM APIs. It should also prove easier to create working
prototypes and experimental languages using this medium.

.License
Both LLVM and _llvm-py_ are distributed under (different) permissive
open source licenses. _llvm-py_ uses the
http://opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php[new BSD license]. More
information is available link:license.html[here].

.Platforms
Currently, _llvm-py_ has been built and tested only on Linux/x86. However,
it should be trivial to build it on other unices. Windows is not
supported, for a variety of reasons.

.Versions
As of now, _llvm-py_ requires the latest SVN version of LLVM. It will
not work with version 2.2 of LLVM. However, 2.3 should be release soon,
and _llvm-py_ should work with stock 2.3 LLVM.

_llvm-py_ has been built and tested with Python 2.5. It should work with
Python 2.4, with minimal changes, if any.


Installation
------------

_llvm-py_ is distributed as a source tarball. You'll need to build and
install it before it can be used. At least the following will be
required for this:

- compilers, both gcc and g++
- Python itself
- Python development files (headers and libraries)
- LLVM, either installed or built

On debian-based systems, the first three can be installed with the
command `sudo apt-get install gcc g++ python python-dev'. Note that
ubuntu repository has an old version of llvm (1.8) which will not work
with _llvm-py_.


llvm-config
~~~~~~~~~~~

Inorder to build llvm-py, it's build script needs to know from where to
invoke the llvm helper program, +llvm-config+. If you've installed LLVM,
then this will be available in your +PATH+, and nothing further needs to
be done. If you've built LLVM yourself, or for any reason +llvm-config+
is not in your +PATH+, you'll need to pass the full path of
+llvm-config+ to the build script.


Steps
~~~~~

The commands illustrated below assume that the LLVM source is available
under +/home/mdevan/llvm+. If you've a previous version of llvm-py
installed, you must remove it first, as described
link:#uninstall[below].

If you have +llvm-config+ in your path, you can build and install
llvm-py this way:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
$ tar jxvf llvm-py-0.2.tar.bz2
$ cd llvm-py-0.2
$ sudo python setup.py install
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you need to tell the build script where +llvm-config+ is, do it this
way:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
$ tar jxvf llvm-py-0.2.tar.bz2
$ cd llvm-py-0.2
$ sudo python setup.py install --llvm-config=/home/mdevan/llvm/Release/bin/llvm-config
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To build a debug version of llvm-py, that links against the debug
libraries of LLVM, use this:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
$ tar jxvf llvm-py-0.2.tar.bz2
$ cd llvm-py-0.2
$ python setup.py build -g --llvm-config=/home/mdevan/llvm/Debug/bin/llvm-config
$ sudo python setup.py install -g --llvm-config=/home/mdevan/llvm/Debug/bin/llvm-config
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Be warned that debug binaries will be huge (65MB+) !


[[uninstall]]
Uninstall
~~~~~~~~~

To get rid of llvm-py completely, if you wish to do so:

----
# rm -rf /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/llvm
# rm -f /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/llvm_py-0.1.egg-info
----

- You need to be root to do this. 
- Paths are for debian-based systems, in other distros it might be different.
- Note that there are version numbers (both Python's and llvm-py's)
  which you might need to change to suit your system.


The Concepts
------------

This section explains a few concepts related to LLVM.


Intermediate Representation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The intermediate representation, or IR for short, is an in-memory data
structure that represents executable code. The IR data structures allow
for creation of types, constants, functions, function arguments,
instructions, global variables and so on. For example, to create a
function _sum_ that takes two integers and returns their sum, we need to
follow these steps:

- create an integer type _ti_ of required bitwidth
- create a function type _tf_ which takes two _ti_ -s and returns
  another _ti_
- create a function of type _tf_ named _sum_
- add a _basic block_ to the function
- using a helper object called an _instruction builder_, add two
  instructions into the basic block:
  . an instruction to add the two arguments and store the result into
    a temporary variable
  . a return instruction to return the value of the temporary variable

(A basic block is a block of instructions.)

LLVM has it's own instruction set; the instructions used above (+add+
and +ret+) are from this set. The LLVM instructions are at a higher
level than the usual assembly language; for example there are
instructions related to variable argument handling, exception handling,
and garbage collection. These allow high-level languages to be
represented cleanly in the IR.

The full set of instructions are:

SSA Form and PHI Nodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All LLVM instructions are represented in the _Static Single Assignment_
(SSA) form. Essentially, this means that any variable can be assigned to
only once. Such a representation facilitates better optimization, among
other benefits.

A consequence of single assignment are PHI (+++&#934;+++) nodes. These
are required when a variable can be assigned a different value based on
the path of control flow. For example, the value of +b+ at the end of
execution of the snippet below:

----
a = 1;
if (v < 10)
  a = 2;
b = a;
----

cannot be determined statically. The value of '2' cannot be assigned to
the 'original' +a+, since +a+ can be assigned to only once. There are
two +a+ 's in there, and the last assignment has to choose between which
version to pick. This is accomplished by adding a PHI node:

----
a1 = 1;
if (v < 10)
  a2 = 2;
b = PHI(a1, a2);
----

The PHI node selects +a1+ or +a2+, depending on where the control
reached the PHI node. The argument +a1+ of the PHI node is associated
with the block +"a1 = 1;"+ and +a2+ with the block +"a2 = 2;"+.

PHI nodes have to be explicitly created in the LLVM IR. The LLVM
instruction set therefore has an instruction called _phi_.


LLVM Assembly Language
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The LLVM IR can be represented offline in two formats
- a textual, human-readable form, similar to assembly language, called
  the LLVM assembly language (files with .ll extension) (XXX ?)
- a binary form, called the LLVM bitcode (files with .bc extension)
All three formats (the in-memory IR, the LLVM assembly language and the
LLVM bitcode) represent the _same_ information. Each format can be
converted into the other two formats (using LLVM APIs).

The http://www.llvm.org/demo/[LLVM demo page] lets you type in C or C++
code, converts it into LLVM IR and outputs the IR as LLVM assembly
language code.

Here's a function in C, that calculates the sum of the first _n_
fibonacci numbers:

[C]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
int fibsum(int n)
{
}
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

And here's the corresponding LLVM assembly listing, as provided by the
demo page:

Note the ... TODO ...

The http://www.llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html[LLVM Language Reference]
defines the LLVM assembly language including the entire instruction set.


Modules
~~~~~~~

Modules, in the LLVM IR, are similar to a single _C_ language source
file (.c file). A module contains:

- functions (declarations and definitions)
- global variables and constants
- global type aliases (typedef-s)

Modules are top-level containers; all executable code representation is
contained within modules.


Optimization and Passes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

LLVM provides quite a few optimization algorithms that work on the IR.
These algorithms are organized as _passes_. Each pass does something
specific, like combining redundant instructions. Passes need not always
optimize the IR, it can also do other operations like inserting
instrumentation code, or analysing the IR (the result of which can be
used by passes that do optimizations) or even printing call graphs.

This LLVM http://www.llvm.org/docs/Passes.html[documentation page]
describes all the available passes, and what they do.

LLVM does not automatically choose to run any passes, anytime. Passes
have to be explicitly selected and run on each module. This gives you
the flexibility to choose transformations and optimizations that are
most suitable for the code in the module.

There is a LLVM binary called http://www.llvm.org/cmds/opt.html[opt],
which lets you run passes on bitcode files from the command line. You
can write your own passes (in C/C\+\+, as a shared library). This can be
loaded and executed by +opt+. (Although _llvm-py_ does not allow you to
write your own passes, it does allow you to navigate the entire IR at
any stage, and perform any transforms on it as you like.)

Passes are run using a _pass manager_. For our purposes, there are two
