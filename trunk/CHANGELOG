0.1, 10-May-2008:

  * Initial release.


0.2, ongoing:

  * Independent package, need not be unpacked into llvm/bindings
  * Modules can be dumped to a string
  * Modules can be verified
  * Module.global_variables, Module.functions, Function.args, 
        Function.basic_blocks and BasicBlock.instructions are
        now proper iterators (generators in fact) than plain lists

  * MemoryBuffer is done
  * TypeHandle is done
  * Unit tester added (but doesn't do much for now)
