llvm-py: Python Bindings for LLVM
===================================

llvm-py provides http://www.python.org/[Python] bindings for
http://llvm.org/[LLVM]. It's goal is to expose enough of LLVM APIs to
implement a compiler backend or a VM in pure Python. llvm-py consists of
Python and C modules that wrap over the native C++/C bindings of LLVM,
and does not use / have dependencies on "glue utilities" like
Boost.Python, swig etc.

llvm-py is just hatching. It should be stable enough to start hacking
away, though. Be sure to send in a patch if you miss any specific LLVM
API.

_Availability_: llvm-py is available (as a source package) for LLVM 2.4
and Python 2.5. It has been built and tested on Linux and FreeBSD
(x86 and amd64).
